## 🧩 UX Design Approach

This project was built with **user empathy** at its core. Key UX strategies include:

- ✅ **Inline, contextual feedback** instead of intrusive alerts
- ✅ **Non-blocking hints** to guide rather than interrupt the flow
- ✅ **Smart focus behavior** and intuitive input field highlighting
- ✅ **Smooth transitions** and subtle **micro-interactions**
- ✅ **Horizontal scroll support** using mousewheel on smaller screens
- ✅ **Disclaimer tips and helper texts** for better interaction understanding
